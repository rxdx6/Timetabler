### Timetable and Assignment Manager

This Python script helps students manage their weekly timetable and assignment tracking in one place. You can:

- Schedule lectures (Theory/Lab/Other) with times, locations, and instructors
- Track assignments (regular tasks, lab writeups, and experiment executions)
- Mark assignments as completed
- View daily schedules and pending assignments

## Features

üìÖ **Timetable Management**
- Schedule lectures across Mon-Fri
- Automatic end-time calculation using duration
- Daily schedule display

üìù **Assignment Tracking**
- Add assignments during lectures
- Lab sessions create both writeup AND execution tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Persistent storage in JSON

‚ö†Ô∏è **Proactive Alerts**
- Automatically checks for assignments at runtime
- Shows pending tasks at program exit

## Getting Started

1. **First Run Setup**
```bash

    class Writeup {
        + Inherits from Assignment
        + Lab-specific writeup tasks
    }
    
    class Execution {
        + Inherits from Assignment
        + Lab experiment tasks
    }
    
    class Lecture {
        +str name
        +str type
        +str start_time
        +str end_time
